//! A1 self-dealing insurance-siphon regression tests.
//!
//! # Attack
//!
//! The attacker controls two distinct keypairs on the same market:
//!   • A: a user account, opens a LONG
//!   • B: an LP account, takes the matched SHORT via the default matcher
//!
//! Both sides are filled at the same entry price from the same wallet
//! cluster. The attacker then drops the oracle price sharply. Under a
//! waterfall that over-pays the LP from insurance (§4.17 pre-v12.19),
//! the LP-side profit is funded by insurance while the user-side loss
//! never propagates cleanly, so the aggregate `(A_cap + A_pnl) +
//! (B_cap + B_pnl)` exceeds the pair's combined deposits — and the
//! surplus came out of the insurance fund.
//!
//! # Defense (v12.19)
//!
//! Three layers neuter the attack:
//!
//! 1. `max_price_move_bps_per_slot` — the per-slot oracle-move cap is an
//!    immutable init-time RiskParam. A single-instruction 25% gap is
//!    rejected by `accrue_market_to`, so the attacker can't realize an
//!    adverse move in one shot.
//! 2. §1.4 solvency envelope — `max_price_move * max_accrual_dt +
//!    funding_contribution + liquidation_fee <= maintenance_margin`.
//!    Even across many cranks the worst-case pre-liquidation drift on
//!    LP collateral is bounded by maintenance margin, so insurance never
//!    has to backstop a zero-collateral unwind.
//! 3. Admission-threshold gate — `admit_h_max_consumption_threshold_bps`
//!    (spec §12.21, plumbed through every `_v2`-now-canonical call) stops
//!    a generation with a depleted price-move budget from admitting new
//!    positions or ADL enqueues.
//!
//! # Acceptance criterion
//!
//! For each market type exercised below, the test asserts:
//!
//! ```text
//! attacker_delta  =  (A_cap + A_pnl) + (B_cap + B_pnl)
//!                 -  (A_deposit + B_deposit)
//!                 <=  1         // tolerate 1 unit of integer rounding
//!
//! insurance_after  >=  insurance_before - 1     // non-decreasing (±1)
//! ```
//!
//! A violation (attacker extracts value, or insurance shrinks by more
//! than rounding) would indicate a regression of the v12.19 defense —
//! DO NOT paper over it.
