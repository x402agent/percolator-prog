# Security Audit — v12.18.x

Working log for the ship-blocking audit loop. Only tests that EXPOSE
real bugs are committed to the tree; probes that confirmed safe
behavior are logged here and discarded.

## Findings

(none validated so far in this audit pass)

## Discarded candidates

Each entry records: what I suspected, the concrete exploit attempt,
the code path, and why the concern turned out to be invalid. Tests
written to probe these were deleted; the log is what remains.

### D1. TradeCpi variadic tail — slab aliasing

**Hypothesis**: A malicious caller passes the slab account in the
variadic tail (writable). The wrapper forwards it to the matcher CPI,
giving the matcher a second AccountInfo reference to the slab. The
matcher could bypass the reentrancy guard (set on the slab) or
corrupt engine state via a crafted CPI callback.

**Why discarded**:
- The matcher is not the slab's owner (percolator_prog is). Solana's
  runtime silently discards writes to non-owned accounts; any
  attempted mutation by the matcher is a no-op.
- If the matcher re-enters TradeCpi with the same slab, the
  reentrancy guard `FLAG_CPI_IN_PROGRESS` fires on the inner call and
  rejects.
- The outer `slab_data_mut` borrow is released before the CPI, so the
  matcher can read (not write) the slab. Reads alone can't steal
  funds or corrupt state.

### D2. TradeCpi variadic tail — signer forwarding

**Hypothesis**: Caller sneaks a third-party signer into the tail;
matcher uses the signer to authorize a different action (e.g.
withdraw from the signer's account in another market).

**Why discarded**: Solana tx-level signer flags are bounded by what
the outer tx signed. A third party's signer can only appear in the
tail if that party already co-signed the TradeCpi tx. If they
co-signed, they consented to whatever the matcher does with the
signer — the matcher is explicitly LP-delegated.

### D3. Matcher returns adversarial exec_price

**Hypothesis**: Malicious matcher returns `exec_price_e6` far from
the oracle to fleece the LP's counterparty.

**Why discarded**: Wrapper enforces an anti-off-market band
`|exec_price - oracle| * 10_000 <= max(2 * trading_fee_bps, 100) *
oracle_price` (src/percolator.rs:6040-6061). Minimum band is 1%
(100 bps). Wide bands require operator-set fees; caller-controlled
LP delegation bounds the matcher's latitude.

### D4. Market non-resolvable with last_oracle_price = 0

**Hypothesis**: Non-Hyperp market init succeeds but last_oracle_price
is never seeded (e.g., oracle read skipped on init). Subsequent
stale market has no price to settle at; ResolvePermissionless rejects
(`if p_last == 0 return OracleInvalid`), funds trapped.

**Why discarded**: InitMarket reads the oracle unconditionally for
non-Hyperp markets (src/percolator.rs:4458-4475) and rejects if the
read fails or returns 0. `init_in_place` then seeds
last_oracle_price with the real price. The "last_oracle_price = 0
after init" scenario is unreachable.

### D5. AdminForceCloseAccount / ForceCloseResolved skip ATA verification on zero payout

**Hypothesis**: When force_close returns `Closed(0)`, owner ATA
verification is skipped (`if amt_units > 0`). An attacker could pass
a malicious token account as owner_ata. Later, if some path produced
a nonzero payout without re-verification, funds would leak.

**Why discarded**: `collateral::withdraw` (src/percolator.rs around
line 3000) has `if amount == 0 { return Ok(()); }` — no SPL Transfer
CPI is ever invoked with zero amount. The unverified ATA is never
actually used as a transfer destination.

### D6. Self-trade via same-owner LP + user

**Hypothesis**: Attacker sets up one owner controlling both an LP
account (with a matcher they control) and a user account. They
"trade" between them to move the mark EWMA or accumulate funding at
no cost.

**Why discarded**: Every trade routes fees to the insurance fund
(100% of fee, both sides). The attacker pays REAL fees in
proportion to the trade notional. The fee-weighted EWMA + mark_min
_fee threshold in the spec design means the attacker must burn real
capital to move the mark. The engine blocks exact `a == b`
(src/percolator.rs:3900 in the engine crate).

### D7. ResolvePermissionless at split current_slot > last_market_slot

**Hypothesis**: After my InitUser pure-deposit change, current_slot
can exceed last_market_slot on a no-oracle path. If
ResolvePermissionless runs in that state, does it corrupt
resolved_slot or produce incorrect settlement?

**Why discarded**: `engine.resolve_market_not_atomic(Degenerate, ...,
clock.slot, 0)` passes clock.slot as resolved_slot. Engine validates
`now_slot >= current_slot` (monotonicity). The Degenerate arm runs at
rate=0, so no funding accumulation with stale fund_px_last. Settlement
is at last_oracle_price (seeded at init, updated by every
accrue-bearing op). No path corrupts resolved state.

### D8. LiquidateAtOracle partial liquidation leaves account below MM

**Hypothesis**: Partial liquidation reduces position but leaves
account still undercollateralized, allowing the liquidator to
repeatedly extract fees without actually closing the risk.

**Why discarded**: Wrapper invokes
`liquidate_at_oracle_not_atomic(target_idx, ...,
LiquidationPolicy::FullClose, ...)` (src/percolator.rs:6299-6304).
The FullClose policy flattens the position in one call. There is no
partial liquidation path exposed at the wrapper.

## Methodology

For each hypothesis above, I:
1. Located the code path supposedly enabling the exploit.
2. Drafted a concrete test sequence.
3. Either ran the test (if it was small enough to execute) or walked
   the code mechanically to prove the exploit is blocked.
4. Discarded the finding when the proof held.

## Hard rules followed

- No finding committed without a failing test.
- No tests committed for hypotheses that turned out not to be bugs.
- Where the proof is mechanical (D5, D6, D7), I trace the exact line
  numbers that block the exploit rather than writing a ceremonial
  passing test.

### D9. KeeperCrank reward lets attacker siphon insurance

**Hypothesis**: Attacker creates many dummy accounts that accrue
maintenance fees, then cranks first after a long wait to collect 50%
of the sweep. Net profit from insurance fund.

**Why discarded**: The attacker's dummy accounts ARE the ones paying
the swept fees. Net flow: attacker pays N × fee_per_slot × dt → 50%
back to attacker (their own sweep), 50% to insurance. Net LOSS of
50% on their dummy-account fees. Not profitable.

### D10. CloseSlab drains unsolicited vault tokens to close_authority

**Hypothesis**: Users who mistakenly transfer tokens directly to the
vault PDA (outside DepositCollateral) have their tokens stolen when
close_authority calls CloseSlab — the "stranded" drain sends those
tokens to close_authority.

**Why discarded**: Not a protocol vulnerability — this is user error
(sending tokens outside the deposit path). Documented behavior.
`verify_vault_empty` at InitMarket (line 3873) checks
`tok.amount == 0`, so an admin cannot pre-load a vault with stranded
tokens. Running a vault through the full lifecycle (deposits → full
withdrawals → close) leaves engine.vault at 0; any "stranded" amount
is strictly unsolicited.

### D12. ReclaimEmptyAccount donates user dust to insurance

**Hypothesis**: After my sync-before-reclaim fix, a keeper can
force-realize maintenance fees on a flat user account, dropping
capital below min_initial_deposit, then reclaim the account — the
user's remaining dust capital (potentially almost a full
min_initial_deposit) goes permanently to the insurance fund. The
user has no way to recover it.

**Attack sequence**:
1. User deposits exactly min_initial_deposit (e.g., 100). Opens and
   closes a position. Leaves 100 capital with no open position.
2. Maintenance fee accrues: 1/slot × N slots = N fees owed but not
   yet realized (no crank has run).
3. Keeper calls ReclaimEmptyAccount. My added sync realizes N fees,
   capital drops to 100−N. If 100−N < 100, reclaim eligibility
   passes.
4. Engine's reclaim path (engine line 5352-5359) transfers dust
   capital to insurance, zeros user capital, frees slot. User has no
   slot or capital left.

**Why discarded** (not a vuln, by design):
- Reclaim requires position=0, pnl=0, reserved_pnl=0, sched_present=0,
  pending_present=0, fee_credits>=0 (engine line 5314-5331). Only
  truly flat, abandoned accounts are eligible.
- User can call WithdrawCollateral at any point ONLY UNTIL fees
  exceed capital. After that, withdraw fails with
  `EngineInsufficientBalance` (0x0d). CORRECTION: my earlier
  wording "at any point" was imprecise. Spot-check test verified
  this: with maint_fee_per_slot=10 and 20 slots idle, a min-
  deposit user's capital (100) is exceeded by owed fees (200);
  capital drains to 0, fee_debt accumulates, reclaim eligible.
  User cannot withdraw at that point.
- Still not a ship-blocker: the USER's mitigation is to deposit
  above min + close active before going offline for a period
  longer than the fee-exhaustion window. Maint_fee is immutable
  after init (no UpdateConfig path), so users can see the rate
  and size their deposit accordingly.
- Admin's choice of maint_fee_per_slot determines the user-fund-
  at-risk surface. Aggressive fees → faster drain. Realistic
  fees (~1 per hour) → multi-month-long survival for min deposits.
  Operators should set maint_fee thoughtfully.
- Pre-fix behavior was identical in the end state: fees are OWED
  regardless of when they're realized. My fix just makes reclaim
  realize them synchronously (matching spec §10.7). Without the
  fix, reclaim failed to realize pending fees — meaning an
  abandoned account with unrealized fees would indefinitely block
  the slot while the user's capital was silently unrecoverable.
- This is the spec's documented dormant-account cleanup path
  (spec §2.6). Not theft; abandoned-dust → insurance is the
  intended economic rule.

### D11. TradeCpi tail meta with forged signer flag

**Hypothesis**: Caller crafts a tail AccountMeta with
`is_signer: true` for an account that did NOT actually sign the outer
tx, hoping the matcher CPI sees the account as a signer and uses it
to authorize a privileged action on another slab.

**Why discarded**: Solana's runtime validates every
`AccountMeta { is_signer: true }` against the set of actual signers
on the outer tx. An AccountMeta's signer flag is only respected in
CPI privilege propagation if the account's `AccountInfo.is_signer` is
already true — which only happens when the outer tx was signed by
that account. A caller cannot fake signer privileges on a tail
account. My tail forwarding code preserves `tail_ai.is_signer`
verbatim (src/percolator.rs around the TradeCpi metas loop), which
is pass-through of the existing privilege — no elevation possible.

### D13. Nonce wrapping replay on TradeCpi

**Hypothesis**: `req_id` nonce wraps after 2^64 increments, allowing
a stored matcher_ctx buffer from an old trade to match a new request
with the same req_id modulo wrap.

**Why discarded**: `verify::nonce_on_success` (src/percolator.rs:384)
uses `checked_add(1)` and propagates None as rejection
(src/percolator.rs:5789 treats overflow as `EngineOverflow`). No
wraparound possible; at 2^64 trades, the market halts cleanly rather
than replaying. Not a practical attack surface (>10^11 years at 1
trade per 0.4s slot).

### D14. Matcher_ctx aliasing with slab

**Hypothesis**: Attacker passes the slab as `matcher_ctx`. After the
CPI returns, the wrapper reads matcher return data from the slab
bytes, potentially smuggling crafted slab state as a valid matcher
return.

**Why discarded**: `verify::matcher_shape_ok`
(src/percolator.rs:5668-5676) requires
`ctx_owner_is_prog: a_matcher_ctx.owner == a_matcher_prog.key`. The
slab is owned by `percolator_prog`, not the matcher program, so this
check fails before the CPI.

### D15. Account close bypasses warmup

**Hypothesis**: User opens a position, matures positive PnL into
reserved_pnl, then calls CloseAccount to extract the pending bucket
as capital before warmup period elapses.

**Why discarded**: `close_account_not_atomic`
(percolator/src/percolator.rs:4888-4894) rejects with
`Undercollateralized` if ANY of:
- `reserved_pnl != 0`
- `sched_present != 0`
- `pending_present != 0`
All three warmup signals must be clean before close. Early close
with pending warmup PnL is not possible.

### D16. InitMarket with zero admin

**Hypothesis**: Admin is set to `[0; 32]` at init; `require_admin`
check would need careful handling or a malicious caller with a zero
signer key (unreachable but worth checking) could spoof admin.

**Why discarded**: `verify::admin_ok`
(src/percolator.rs:339-341) explicitly rejects
`admin == [0; 32]`. The zero address is reserved for "burned"
state; no signer can claim admin privileges against a zero-admin
header. InitMarket sets admin to `a_admin.key.to_bytes()`
(src/percolator.rs:4633) — if the admin signer is zero, it fails
validation upstream (Solana signer-flag checks).

### D21. Cross-market reentrancy via malicious matcher

**Hypothesis**: During TradeCpi's matcher CPI in market A, the
malicious matcher CPIs back to the wrapper with a DIFFERENT slab
(market B). The reentrancy flag `FLAG_CPI_IN_PROGRESS` is scoped to
market A's slab, so market B's operations would see the flag unset
and proceed. Could this grant privileges the attacker didn't have?

**Why discarded**: Cross-market ops from inside matcher CPI require
the attacker to already have privileges on market B:
- Admin-gated ops need B's admin to sign (not available to matcher)
- LP PDA signing uses market B's slab in seeds (different from A's)
- User-signed ops need B's user to sign (attacker's own user, fine)
- Permissionless ops (Crank, CatchupAccrue, ResolvePermissionless)
  are already callable by anyone

The matcher cannot elevate privileges via cross-slab CPI. It can
only do what the attacker could already do by calling market B
directly. Not a reentrancy flaw.

### D23. Stale matcher_ctx data passes ABI validation

**Hypothesis**: Malicious matcher writes `req_id=N` to matcher_ctx
then panics before writing exec_price. Wrapper reads ctx, sees
req_id=N matches current request, accepts. Partial data bypasses
security.

**Why discarded**: `validate_matcher_return` checks ALL of:
`abi_version == v2`, `flags has VALID + !REJECTED`, `lp_account_id ==
expected`, `oracle_price_e6 == expected`, `reserved == 0`,
`req_id == expected`, AND `exec_price_e6 != 0`. A partial write that
leaves exec_price = 0 (or any zero field) is rejected. The request
ID is strictly monotonic, so stale data from prior trades has a
different req_id and gets rejected.

### D24. Fee debt forgiveness at reclaim is theft from insurance

**Hypothesis**: Account reaches reclaim eligibility with negative
fee_credits (unpaid fee debt). On reclaim, engine zeroes the debt
(engine reclaim line: `self.accounts[idx].fee_credits = I128::new(0)`).
Insurance fund permanently loses this expected revenue.

**Why discarded**: Spec §2.6 explicitly describes this as debt
write-off for abandoned accounts. Not theft — the user had no capital
to pay (else reclaim wouldn't fire). Charging a zero-capital account
more fees is accounting theater. Insurance only loses revenue it
would not have collected anyway.

### D25. LP matcher registration cannot be changed

**Hypothesis**: LP's matcher_program and matcher_context are set at
InitLP and immutable. If the matcher is upgraded or compromised,
the LP is stuck with the broken matcher forever — effectively their
funds are controlled by whoever controls the matcher upgrade key.

**Why discarded**: LP can CloseAccount (wrapper handles final
settlement) and re-init with a new matcher. The "immutability" is
within a single account's lifetime, not across re-init. Operational
risk (LP should pick a matcher whose upgrade authority they trust)
but not a protocol-level vulnerability.

### D26. WithdrawInsurance drains user funds

**Hypothesis**: Admin (as insurance_authority) calls WithdrawInsurance
while users still have open accounts, stealing what users believe is
their capital via the shared vault balance.

**Why discarded**: The handler (src/percolator.rs:7529-7531) checks
`if engine.num_used_accounts != 0 → reject`. Admin must wait for
every user account to close (via AdminForceCloseAccount or user
self-close) before withdrawing insurance. At num_used_accounts=0,
c_tot=0, pnl_pos_tot=0 (further asserted lines 7546-7550), the vault
contents are not owed to any user — withdrawing is correct
accounting.

### D27. WithdrawInsurance with burned insurance_authority traps funds

**Hypothesis**: Admin burns insurance_authority before the market
has drained. Later all users close. Insurance balance is nonzero
but nobody can call WithdrawInsurance (require_admin rejects zero).

**Why discarded**: Not a user-fund-theft vulnerability — it's the
protocol's own excess capital trapped. The design is intentional:
operators who want "rug-proof for users" can burn
insurance_authority at init, knowing that insurance will never be
paid out. Users' individual claims are already withdrawable via
close/force-close. The trapped insurance is structurally designed
to be inaccessible.

### D28. UpdateConfig funding param change retroactively reprices accrual

**Hypothesis**: Admin calls UpdateConfig to change funding_k_bps or
funding_max_bps_per_slot. The accrued period [last_market_slot,
clock.slot] is re-priced at the NEW rate, retroactively applying
the admin's chosen rate to elapsed time.

**Why discarded**: UpdateConfig captures `funding_rate_e9` BEFORE
any config mutation (src/percolator.rs:6763) and passes it to
`catchup_accrue` + `accrue_market_to` (lines 6842-6847). ONLY
after the accrue completes does the handler write the new funding
params (lines 6856-6859). The accrued interval uses the pre-change
rate. Post-accrue time uses the new rate. Anti-retroactivity is
preserved (spec §5.5).

### D29. LP with stuck counterparty positions cannot close

**Hypothesis**: LP has matched several user trades and accumulated
positions. Users never close their sides. LP cannot CloseAccount
because position != 0. Funds trapped.

**Why discarded**: Not a bug — standard perp-market lifecycle. LP
must trade OUT of each position (or wait for liquidation /
resolution). If no counterparty is willing to trade the other way,
the market still eventually resolves (admin or permissionless
timeout), and resolved close returns LP's capital.
Perp-market liquidity is an operational concern, not a
vulnerability.

### D30. Trade at exec_price clamped to MAX_ORACLE_PRICE

**Hypothesis**: Matcher returns exec_price exactly at
MAX_ORACLE_PRICE (10^12). Engine's notional computation overflows.

**Why discarded**: MAX_POSITION_ABS_Q = 10^14. notional = size ×
price / POS_SCALE = 10^14 × 10^12 / 10^15 = 10^11, well within
u128 range. The engine's envelope invariant (spec §1.4) guarantees
all arithmetic stays under i128::MAX (~1.7×10^38) across the full
product of (size × price × rate × lifetime).

### D31. Account slot DoS by single attacker

**Hypothesis**: Attacker creates min_initial_deposit-sized accounts
until all `params.max_accounts` slots are full. No other user can
init. Market is bricked.

**Why discarded** (not a fund-theft vuln, operational):
- Attacker does NOT lose funds — they can CloseAccount any time to
  recover their deposits. Funds are LOCKED during the DoS, not
  stolen or trapped.
- `max_accounts` is operator-configured at init (up to 4096).
  Operators who want higher DoS resistance set max_accounts high
  AND/OR require higher min_initial_deposit so the attack costs more.
- A DoS-sized attack on a market with max_accounts=4096 and
  min_initial_deposit=100 base tokens costs the attacker
  ~409_600 base tokens of locked capital for however long they
  choose to maintain the DoS.
- No existing user's funds or positions are affected. Existing users
  can continue to trade, close, liquidate. Only NEW user onboarding
  is blocked.
- Spec §2.2 documents max_accounts as an operator choice. Not a
  protocol bug; an economic-model consideration.

### D22. Dust-capital account remains operational

**Hypothesis**: User's capital drops below min_initial_deposit (e.g.,
via fee sweeps). The account is "reclaimable dust" eligible, but
still operationally active. Can the user accidentally trigger
reclaim by calling their own instructions, losing dust?

**Why discarded**: Reclaim is a SEPARATE instruction
(ReclaimEmptyAccount). No other instruction auto-reclaims on dust
detection. The user can top up via DepositCollateral any time before
a keeper races in with reclaim. This is the intended dormant-account
cleanup semantics (spec §2.6).

### D32. Malicious matcher: attacker controls matcher program

**Hypothesis**: Attacker is the LP AND controls the matcher program.
They can make the matcher return adversarial exec_prices (within
1% band) to steal a small amount from each counterparty across
many trades.

**Why discarded**: LP delegation to a matcher is an explicit trust
choice. The matcher is bounded by the anti-off-market band (≥1% or
2× trading_fee_bps, whichever is larger). Within that band, the
matcher can indeed pick unfavorable prices for the counterparty —
this is the cost of using that LP. Counterparties can choose a
different LP with a trusted matcher. The wrapper's job is to
ENFORCE the band, not to pick matchers for LPs.

### D33. InitMarket with tiny min_initial_deposit reduces DoS cost

**Hypothesis**: Operator sets min_initial_deposit = 1 base token.
DoS cost drops to 4096 × 1 = 4096 tokens — trivial.

**Why discarded**: Spec parameter choice, operator responsibility.
Wrapper does bound min_initial_deposit (min > 0, max ≤
MAX_VAULT_TVL in RiskParams validation), but does not prescribe a
minimum floor — it's left to operator economics. Not a protocol
bug.

### D34. Same-slot oracle price oscillation

**Hypothesis**: Multiple ixs in a single tx see different oracle
prices (via re-reads or oscillation). Attacker constructs a same-
slot tx that opens a position at one price then closes at another
within the same block, profiting from the oscillation.

**Why discarded**:
- Pyth prices update at most once per slot (deterministic within a
  tx).
- Hyperp mark updates only on successful trades. One trade per tx
  affects the mark for future txs, not the current one.
- Authority push is admin-initiated, not attacker-controllable in
  the same tx as a trade.
- No path allows an attacker to change the oracle state between ixs
  within their own tx without being the oracle authority.

### D35. Scan cursor starvation

**Hypothesis**: KeeperCrank's scan_cursor could be manipulated to
skip specific accounts, letting an insolvent account avoid
liquidation.

**Why discarded**: The cursor is modular (`word_cursor = (word_cursor
+ 1) % BITMAP_WORDS`). All slots are eventually visited. Scan order
is deterministic per cursor state; no one can "skip" an account
persistently. Additionally, LiquidateAtOracle is callable directly
by any keeper without going through crank — so no liquidation is
dependent on crank scanning.

### D36. accrue_market_to same-slot different-price MTM

**Hypothesis**: Within a single slot, multiple accrue calls with
different prices could cause double-counted mark-to-market deltas.

**Why discarded**: accrue_market_to's mark-to-market step uses
`current_price = self.last_oracle_price`, computes `delta_p =
new - old`, and applies delta. After each call,
`last_oracle_price = new`. Subsequent calls use the updated value.
Telescoping sum equals the total mark movement. No double-counting.

### D37. Tiny trades with zero-rounded fees

**Hypothesis**: Trade with size_q = 1 (smallest unit) produces a
notional so small that the trading fee rounds to 0 in integer
arithmetic. Attacker does billions of tiny trades for free to
manipulate state.

**Why discarded**:
- Zero-fee trades contribute ZERO weight to the mark EWMA
  (fee-weighted update). No EWMA manipulation possible.
- Each tiny trade is still a full tx with Solana-level fees (lamports).
  Economic cost to the attacker scales with trade count.
- Position changes of 1-unit size are too small to meaningfully
  affect any other account's health or funding.
- Fee-rounding is asymmetric (ceil) — protocol rounds fees UP when
  possible (`mul_div_ceil_u128`), minimizing free rides.

### D38. Double-crank same slot

**Hypothesis**: Two keepers call KeeperCrank at the same slot.
Double-accrual, double fee-sweep, double reward.

**Why discarded**: Solana tx linearization. First tx lands, accrues
market to the slot. Second tx sees already-accrued state;
`accrue_market_to` with dt=0 is a no-op early return (engine line
2162). Maintenance fee sweep on second call finds nothing to sweep
(first drained the budget). No double-counting.

### D39. Slab lamport drain-induced garbage collection

**Hypothesis**: Attacker somehow drains slab's lamports below rent
exemption, Solana garbage-collects the slab mid-operation, data is
lost.

**Why discarded**: No wrapper path drains slab lamports except
CloseSlab (gated by close_authority + num_used_accounts=0). InitMarket
pays rent at creation. The slab stays rent-exempt throughout its
lifecycle. Solana-level account deletion is not reachable from the
wrapper's API surface.

### D40. Nonce replay after failed TradeCpi

**Hypothesis**: TradeCpi computes req_id but fails after the CPI
(before `write_req_nonce`). Nonce isn't advanced. Next attempt
reuses req_id — could a stale matcher return match and allow a
replay?

**Why discarded**: Tx atomicity. If TradeCpi errors, ALL state
writes (including matcher_ctx if matcher wrote to it) roll back.
The matcher_ctx reverts to its pre-tx state. Nonce counter also
reverts. Next tx starts from the pre-fail state; no stale matcher
return data exists to replay against.

### D41. `num_used_accounts` desync

**Hypothesis**: free_slot / materialize_at updates `num_used_accounts`.
Could a failure path leave the counter out of sync with the
`used` bitmap, causing permanent slot leaks or overcounting?

**Why discarded**: materialize_at (engine line 1149+) has extensive
on-failure decrement rollback (lines 1172, 1182, 1196, 1201, 1206,
1211, 1215). free_slot uses `checked_sub` (line 1137) against the
counter. Any inconsistency would surface as CorruptState immediately,
not a silent leak.

### D42. TradeCpi zero-fill burns nonces without executing trades

**Hypothesis**: Attacker abuses zero-fill returns (exec_size=0 +
PARTIAL_OK) to increment the req_nonce indefinitely, eventually
exhausting the u64 space and bricking trading via
`nonce_on_success → None`.

**Why discarded**: u64 nonce space = 2^64. At 1 trade per 400ms slot,
exhausting takes ~234 billion years. Each nonce burn is a full tx
with Solana-level fees. Economic impossibility, not a protocol flaw.

### D43. Resolved-payout snapshot premature lock

**Hypothesis**: `resolved_payout_h_num/h_den` snapshot locks based on
`is_terminal_ready() == (neg_pnl_account_count == 0)`. If the
counter is ever desynced from reality, the snapshot could lock
prematurely, paying out winners at a favorable ratio that doesn't
account for not-yet-reconciled losers.

**Why discarded**: `neg_pnl_account_count` is maintained via
`checked_add/checked_sub` at every PnL/capital transition point
(set_pnl line 1466-1469, set_capital line 1527-1532). Any
inconsistency surfaces as CorruptState immediately. There is no
silent-drift path: the counter is only updated inside the state
mutation functions that also control the sign transitions, so it
reflects the actual count at all times.

### D44. c_tot desync on close

**Hypothesis**: CloseAccount removes user's capital from vault but
could miss updating `c_tot`, leaving c_tot elevated post-close.
Conservation `V >= C_tot + I` would then be violated (V decreased
more than C_tot).

**Why discarded**: All capital mutations route through `set_capital`
(engine line 1588) which applies the signed delta to c_tot using
checked arithmetic. CloseAccount's `set_capital(idx, 0)` decrements
c_tot by exactly the account's prior capital. `assert_public_post
conditions` then verifies conservation; a drift would surface as
CorruptState.

### D45. Haircut ratio with senior sum overflow

**Hypothesis**: `c_tot + insurance_fund.balance` overflows u128,
engine treats this as residual=0 (maximum haircut). Could this be
exploited to force-haircut winners unfairly?

**Why discarded**: c_tot ≤ MAX_VAULT_TVL (10^16), insurance ≤
MAX_VAULT_TVL (10^16). Sum ≤ 2×10^16 ≪ u128::MAX (~3.4×10^38).
Overflow is not reachable in practice. The conservative "treat as
zero residual" on hypothetical overflow is a SAFE failure mode:
winners get MORE haircut (smaller payout) which preserves
conservation V ≥ C_tot + I. Cannot cause over-payout to winners.

### D46. Zero-margin configuration

**Hypothesis**: Admin sets initial_margin_bps = 0 at init. User
opens huge positions with only min_nonzero_im_req capital,
creating risk the protocol can't cover.

**Why discarded**: Wrapper rejects `initial_margin_bps == 0` at
init (src/percolator.rs:4190-4194). Both initial and maintenance
must be nonzero. Admin cannot configure a zero-margin market.

### D47. Insurance-floor drain via inflated losses

**Hypothesis**: Attacker triggers loss cascades to drain insurance
to the floor, leaving legitimate later losses to hit junior haircut
early. Winners get haircut that wouldn't have fired without the
attacker's actions.

**Why discarded**: Losses require the ATTACKER's position to move
against them. To cause large losses that drain insurance, attacker
must themselves lose money. Net economic flow: attacker pays loss
out of their capital → drains insurance → haircut on winners.
Attacker doesn't benefit from the haircut (they're not the winner).
Attacker cost > any gain; not rational.

### D48. Junior haircut preservation (record_uninsured_protocol_loss)

**Hypothesis**: After insurance is drained, the remaining uninsured
loss gets "double-counted" — once via haircut on matured pos, once
via vault reduction — unfairly penalizing winners.

**Why discarded**: `record_uninsured_protocol_loss` (engine line
2326) is explicitly a no-op per spec §4.17. Code comment documents
the exact reason: double-draining would penalize winners twice. The
current implementation is correct — losses are absorbed purely via
the haircut mechanism after insurance is drained, without additional
vault reduction.

### D49. Cross-close reconcile ordering

**Hypothesis**: In a resolved market with many winners and losers,
the order in which users call CloseAccount matters. Closing losers
first vs. winners first might produce different total payouts due
to haircut snapshot timing.

**Why discarded**: The haircut snapshot (`resolved_payout_h_num/
h_den`) is LOCKED AT THE MOMENT `is_terminal_ready()` becomes true
— which is exactly when `neg_pnl_account_count` reaches 0 (all
losers reconciled). Winners calling Phase 2 before this point
receive `ProgressOnly` (no payout, just persistence). After the
snapshot locks, every winner's payout uses the SAME (h_num, h_den).
Order-invariant by design.

### D50. Epoch wrap in stale-reconcile check

**Hypothesis**: `adl_epoch_snap` is u64; after 2^64 epochs, wrap
could make `epoch_snap + 1 == epoch_side` spuriously match a
non-stale account in a corrupted way.

**Why discarded**: Epoch increments only on reset_pending → reset
lifecycle, which happens at most a few times per market. Reaching
2^64 epochs would take >10^10 years of continuous reset activity.
Not a practical attack surface; the engine uses `checked_add(1)` at
line 5155 which would fail with `None` on wrap, producing
CorruptState rejection rather than a silent wrap-induced match.

### D51. Mat_counter overflow

**Hypothesis**: u64 mat_counter wraps after 2^64 materializations,
allowing gen collision → stale lp_account_id matches new account.

**Why discarded**: `next_mat_counter` uses checked_add (line 2165),
returns None on overflow. Callers map None to EngineOverflow error
rejection. 2^64 materializations is not practically reachable.

### D52. Empty-market keeper crank

**Hypothesis**: Keeper cranks on a market with num_used_accounts=0.
Some state mutation or reward payment could happen on the empty
state that shouldn't.

**Why discarded**: Crank with no accounts: scan finds no bits set,
no candidates processed, no fees swept (no accounts to sweep).
`sweep_delta = 0` → reward gate at line 5327 (`sweep_delta > 0`)
blocks reward payment. Crank returns cleanly; no state mutation
beyond the accrue-to-clock-slot (which is the correct ongoing
market-clock advancement, not a bug).

### D53. Funding f_snap desync

**Hypothesis**: When an account changes position, `f_snap` is
updated to the current side's `f_{side}_num`. If this update is
missed on some code path, subsequent funding PnL computation would
use stale snapshot, producing wrong PnL.

**Why discarded**: `set_position_basis_q` (engine line 1700-1717) is
the single entry point for position changes; it atomically updates
`adl_a_basis`, `adl_k_snap`, `f_snap`, `adl_epoch_snap` together.
No mutation path sets position without going through this function.
The engine's 243 Kani proofs include invariants verifying this
snapshot synchronicity.

### D54. ADL coefficient reset during epoch transition

**Hypothesis**: When epoch resets (side becomes ResetPending →
reopen), `f_{side}_num` and `adl_coeff_{side}` are zeroed. If this
happens while an account still holds epoch_snap of the OLD epoch,
reconcile can't reconstruct old PnL.

**Why discarded**: The engine reconciles stale-epoch accounts
(spec §5.4) by using `F_epoch_start_{side}` (the F value snapshotted
at epoch start, NOT current F). Reconcile line 5166:
`f_end_wide = I256::from_i128(self.get_f_epoch_start(side))`. So the
reset doesn't lose the information needed for prior-epoch
reconciliation.

### D55. clamp_oracle_price saturating underflow

**Hypothesis**: `clamp_oracle_price` computes `lower = last_price -
max_delta`. If `max_delta > last_price`, the subtraction saturates
to 0, allowing `raw_price = 0` to be accepted as a valid clamped
price — but `OracleInvalid` check rejects price=0 elsewhere. Does
any path accept a 0 price?

**Why discarded**: Every oracle consumer (`read_pyth_price_e6`,
`read_chainlink_price_e6`, `read_authority_price`) checks for
price=0 and rejects with `OracleInvalid`. The clamp's saturating
behavior is only applied AFTER validation ensures the raw input is
nonzero; even if the clamped value were 0, the downstream
`if mark == 0 → OracleInvalid` (e.g., line 2951 in
`get_engine_oracle_price_e6`) rejects it.

### D56. Fee sweep cursor infinite loop

**Hypothesis**: If only word 0 of the bitmap has set bits (e.g., 64
accounts in a 4096-slot market), the cursor could loop endlessly
between word 0 and wrap-around.

**Why discarded**: Outer loop (line 3603) is bounded by
`words_scanned < BITMAP_WORDS`, terminating after exactly
BITMAP_WORDS=64 iterations regardless of bit distribution. Each
word is visited at most once per crank.

### D57. Admin-controlled funding rate extraction

**Threat model**: Compromised/malicious admin extracts user capital
via adversarial funding rate + mark manipulation. Classic
centralized-protocol rug vector.

**Exploit path**:
1. Attacker is admin AND oracle_authority on a live market with
   open user positions.
2. Attacker opens a large LP on the opposite side of users'
   aggregate exposure (e.g., SHORT if users are net LONG).
3. Attacker calls PushOraclePrice to push the mark significantly
   away from the index, creating a large premium.
4. Attacker calls UpdateConfig to raise `funding_max_bps_per_slot`
   to the engine-enforced max of 10 bps/slot (21,600% per day at
   max rate).
5. Funding accrues against users' positions; their capital shrinks
   each slot, transferring to attacker's LP.
6. Users who don't close positions fast enough lose up to 100%
   of their capital over hours.
7. Attacker closes LP, withdraws profit.

**Why this is not a protocol vulnerability**:
- User can ALWAYS CloseAccount to exit and reclaim remaining
  capital. No permanent lock.
- Conservation V ≥ C_tot + I is preserved — funding is a transfer
  between users' accounts, not a mint/burn.
- The cap `MAX_ABS_FUNDING_E9_PER_SLOT = 10^6` is protocol-enforced;
  any higher would violate the engine's i128 envelope. This is the
  MAXIMUM admin can set.
- The protocol explicitly supports "burn admin after init" as a
  user-protection feature. Markets with burned admin cannot have
  their funding params adversarially updated.
- Spec §5 documents funding as admin-configurable within the
  envelope. Users must trust admin (or use burned-admin markets).

**Why this is classified as "operational risk, not protocol bug"**:
The protocol's trust model explicitly includes admin configuration.
Users entering a market with a live admin accept that admin can
update params. The protocol provides THREE mitigations:
1. Admin can be burned (rug-proof markets)
2. Per-market cap (operators can lower the effective cap below
   engine max when they deploy)
3. User's close-position escape hatch

**Lazarus-style attacker would look at**: the engine's envelope max
(10 bps/slot) as the WORST CASE and ask "does any honest market
deployment need higher than 1 bps/slot? If not, the envelope
max should match real-world funding caps to limit admin abuse
surface." This is an operational recommendation, not a ship-blocker:
deployers choose their own per-market caps.

**Attack surface for a sophisticated attacker**:
- Compromise admin's private key (social engineering, key theft)
- Then follow the exploit path above
- Mitigation: burn admin, or use multisig/timelock for admin

## Sophisticated-attacker analysis (Lazarus-style)

Thinking like a professional DeFi hacker, the high-value attacks
typically target one of these surfaces:

1. **Admin-key compromise + config abuse** — D57 analyzed this. The
   protocol's design bounds admin abuse to funding-rate manipulation
   within the envelope max. Users can always close; protocol
   conservation preserved. Operational risk, not a protocol flaw.

2. **Oracle manipulation** — circuit-breaker caps per-push movement
   (cap_e2bps). Admin/oracle_authority can drive moves within cap.
   User's close-escape limits per-block exposure. Hard-timeout
   `permissionless_stale_matured` forces resolution after sustained
   staleness. Bounded attack surface.

3. **Cross-protocol composition (matcher CPI tail)** — D1/D11/D14
   covered. The matcher is LP-delegated; anything the matcher does
   is within the LP's trust model. Wrapper enforces account shape
   + signer propagation + ABI validation. No privilege elevation
   possible through the tail.

4. **Reentrancy** — `FLAG_CPI_IN_PROGRESS` blocks reentry on the
   same slab. Cross-slab reentry (D21) can't elevate privileges
   beyond what attacker already has.

5. **Token transfer / mint tricks** — verify_token_program checks
   legacy `spl_token::ID` (rejects Token-2022 fee extensions).
   `verify_vault_empty` at init rejects pre-loaded vaults.
   `verify_token_account` checks mint + owner on every transfer.

6. **State initialization / layout** — D56/D45/D55 covered.
   `slab_guard` checks owner + length + reentrancy. Instruction
   decoder uses checked reads. No uninitialized-data exploits.

7. **Arithmetic precision** — D30/D45/D55 covered. Fee
   computation uses ceil (protocol wins rounding). Wide
   arithmetic (U256/I256) for haircut + K-diff paths. Envelope
   invariant ensures products stay within i128::MAX.

8. **Flash-loan-style attacks** — Solana doesn't have native flash
   loans. Multi-ix tx is atomic (D17). No repeated-borrow
   primitives. The circuit breaker bounds same-slot price
   manipulation.

9. **MEV / sandwich** — limit_price_e6 on TradeCpi bounds slippage.
   User can refuse to execute outside their limit. Standard perp
   protection.

10. **Governance / upgrade attacks** — percolator has NO governance
    mechanism. The program owner controls upgrades; that's a
    Solana-level trust assumption.

**Conclusion**: Every standard DeFi attack pattern I considered
either (a) doesn't apply to this architecture, (b) is blocked by
existing defenses, or (c) requires admin-key compromise (which the
burn-admin feature mitigates). No ship-blocking protocol-level
vulnerability identified.

### D58. Dust-window griefing via rapid reclaim

**Threat**: User deposits exactly min_initial_deposit. Attacker
waits a few slots for maintenance fees to accumulate, then calls
ReclaimEmptyAccount. Sync drains fees; capital drops below min;
reclaim eligibility passes; user's dust goes to insurance.

**Why classified as known behavior (D12 variant)**:
- This is spec §2.6 dormant-account cleanup — the user deposited
  the MINIMUM, so any fee accrual pushes them to reclaimable dust.
- User's mitigation: deposit more than min_initial_deposit so
  fee-window eats less than the buffer.
- Maintenance fee is admin-configurable. Markets with fee=0 are
  immune (no dust drain).
- My sync-before-reclaim fix made this attack faster, but the end
  state (user loses dust to insurance) is unchanged from the pre-
  fix behavior once crank eventually syncs their fees.
- Discussed in D12. Same analysis applies.

### D59. All-losers-never-close post-resolve trap

**Threat**: Post-resolve, winners can only Phase-2-close after ALL
losers have Phase-1-reconciled (terminal_ready). If some losers
never get force-closed, winners' funds are locked forever.

**Why discarded**:
- ForceCloseResolved is PERMISSIONLESS past force_close_delay_slots.
  Any keeper can close any account.
- MAX_FORCE_CLOSE_DELAY_SLOTS = 10_000_000 (≈46 days at 0.4s/slot)
  caps the admin's choice.
- Phase 1 reconcile (which decrements neg_pnl_account_count) works
  on any account regardless of capital state — it only zeros the
  position and settles losses.
- Worst case: winners wait up to MAX_FORCE_CLOSE_DELAY_SLOTS (46
  days) before they can force-close losers. Not permanent.

### D60. PDA collision to all-zero pubkey

**Threat**: A PDA derivation accidentally produces all-zero pubkey.
`admin_ok` rejects zero admin, but other checks might treat zero
as "unset" differently.

**Why discarded**: find_program_address uses sha256-based hashing
with off-curve requirement. The probability of hitting all-zero
(2^-256) is astronomically low. Additionally, `admin_ok` (line
339-341) and owner checks consistently treat zero as "unset/burned",
not as a valid active signer. Even if collision occurred, no path
grants privileges to it.

## Key operator recommendation (not a protocol bug)

The one genuine finding from this adversarial session is OPERATIONAL,
not a protocol flaw: `MAX_ABS_FUNDING_E9_PER_SLOT = 10^6` (10 bps/
slot = 21,600%/day at max rate) is mathematically bounded by the
engine's i128 envelope, but 500x higher than real-world perp
funding caps (Binance/dYdX ~0.02 bps/slot).

An admin-compromised market with oracle_authority can push funding
at 10 bps/slot, draining users who don't close fast. This is:
- Within the protocol's documented trust model (admin-configurable
  within envelope)
- Mitigable via: burn admin, or deploy with a lower per-market cap
  via custom_max_per_slot at InitMarket

Operator recommendation: deploy with custom_max_per_slot ≤ 1 bps/
slot (100_000 in e9 units) to align with real-world funding caps
and reduce the admin-abuse surface even without burning admin.
This is a 10x reduction from the envelope max.

Separately, for true rug-proof deployments: burn admin post-init.
The UpdateConfig path then has no authorized signer, so
funding params become immutable.

## Spot-check verification

Per user request, 4 discarded hypotheses were spot-checked with
actual runnable tests (committed, then deleted per the audit rule):

- **D1** (TradeCpi slab in writable tail): test passed — tx
  succeeds or fails atomically, no state corruption. Confirmed.
- **D6** (self-trade fees): code walk confirmed — both sides
  charged `fee`, routed via `charge_fee_to_insurance` (engine lines
  4094-4095). Attacker pays 2×fee net. Confirmed.
- **D12** (reclaim dust): test revealed my original wording ("user
  can withdraw at any point before reclaim fires") was IMPRECISE —
  once maint_fees exceed capital, withdraw fails with 0x0d. NOT a
  protocol bug (spec §2.6 dust cleanup + admin-configurable maint_
  fee), but the D12 description has been corrected above.
- **D16** (zero admin): `admin_ok` explicitly rejects both zero-
  admin-header and zero-signer cases. Confirmed via direct function
  test.

The discards remain valid. D12's wording was tightened.

## Audit completion status

**54 concrete attack hypotheses probed across three rounds.** Every
candidate discarded under inspection. No ship-blocking findings.

### Coverage

Rounds 1 + 2 together walked:
- All 28 live instruction tags — each handler's account layout,
  signature requirements, state transitions, and failure modes.
- Cross-instruction state transitions: InitUser's current_slot
  split, TradeCpi's reentrancy guard, post-resolve close paths.
- Privilege model: the 4-way authority split (admin / oracle /
  insurance / close), burn guards, zero-address rejection.
- Oracle paths: Pyth, Chainlink, authority fallback, circuit
  breaker, hard-timeout gate, Hyperp EWMA.
- Matcher ABI: account-shape validation, signer forwarding in the
  variadic tail, return-field echo validation, reentrancy.
- Warmup / reserve mechanics: close-path rejection of any reserve
  state, ConvertReleasedPnl's flat-account safety cap.
- Money-flow paths: maintenance fee → insurance, trading fee →
  insurance, liquidation fee → insurance, reclaim dust → insurance,
  stranded vault → close_authority.
- Nonce / replay: checked_add bounds, per-slab scoping.
- Layout safety: zero-copy cast, bool/enum validation before cast.

### Residual review scope

Worth someone else's eyes because I didn't construct custom test
infrastructure for them:
- Funding rate AT MAX_ABS_FUNDING_E9_PER_SLOT with OI AT MAX_VAULT_TVL
  on both sides — exact arithmetic stress at the envelope boundary.
- Multi-block attacks where the attacker coordinates across tx
  boundaries (e.g., keeper-timing collusion between miner + attacker).
- Future multi-market deployments would need re-audit of cross-slab
  isolation.

### Confidence

The wrapper has 646 integration tests + 243 Kani proofs (across
wrapper and engine crates) + 19 proptest fuzzers. The instructions
under test here are not green-field code — each has been through
multiple prior audit rounds with specific regression tests. This
round found no new class of bug that those prior rounds missed.

That is consistent with a system that's been adversarially audited
to convergence. It is NOT proof of complete absence of bugs — just
that the straightforward attack vectors tried here don't land.

## Next sweep targets

Remaining angles for future sweeps:
- Multi-tx coordinated: stale-market + reward timing across blocks
- Cross-market: currently single-market design, but multi-market
  deployment would need re-audit
- Engine-side: the engine crate (`percolator`) has its own audit
  surface; prior Kani proofs + proptest fuzzing cover most paths
- Specific funding rate edge: rate = MAX_ABS_FUNDING_E9_PER_SLOT
  with opposing OI of MAX_VAULT_TVL. Finding the test infrastructure
  for this was out-of-scope for this sweep.

### D17. Multi-ix tx: deposit then withdraw same tx bypasses oracle

**Hypothesis**: User submits a tx with [Deposit, Withdraw] ixs in
sequence. Deposit skips oracle (pure capital). Withdraw requires
oracle. If oracle is stale at tx time, does the deposit succeed but
the withdraw fail — trapping the funds mid-tx?

**Why discarded (and not a vuln)**: Solana txs are atomic. If the
Withdraw ix fails, ALL ixs roll back — deposit too. The user's
tokens return to their ATA. No funds trapped.
More: even if the Withdraw succeeded in isolation, the combined tx's
atomicity means a user who BUNDLES them always gets all-or-nothing.
User can also just call Deposit alone; fails gracefully.

### D18. Crank + Trade race within same tx

**Hypothesis**: Tx with [Crank, TradeCpi]. Crank might sync fees on
accounts including the trader's, leaving them below margin. Then
Trade's margin check fails. No attack — just a user paying their
own fees before trading. If trade would succeed pre-sync and fail
post-sync, that's correct: the trader shouldn't be able to open a
position with unrealized-fee-inflated capital.

**Why discarded**: By design. Pre-trade fee realization is the
correct ordering — prevents under-margined trades.

### D19. Sweep_empty_market_surplus on non-empty state

**Hypothesis**: `sweep_empty_market_surplus_to_insurance` (engine
line ~3100s) is called at close/reclaim paths. It should be a
no-op when there are still used accounts or non-zero c_tot. Can it
be triggered in an intermediate state where it incorrectly donates
legitimate capital to insurance?

**Why discarded**: Engine checks `senior = c_tot + insurance` and
only sweeps residual vault EXCESS OVER senior. If c_tot is nonzero,
the "excess" calculation only donates truly unaccounted vault tokens
(rounding dust from base→units conversion, etc.). Legitimate capital
stays in c_tot, not "surplus."

### D20. Free-slot recycling + gen counter collision

**Hypothesis**: User A at idx=5 closes account. Slot freed. User B
inits at idx=5 (same slot reused). A stale offline matcher return
for User A's old req_id could be replayed against User B's trade.

**Why discarded**: Slab has a gen_table (RiskBuffer tail section) —
each InitUser/InitLP bumps a `mat_counter` and writes the new
generation number to idx's slot. `lp_account_id` in TradeCpi
matcher ABI uses this generation. An old matcher return with A's
generation won't match B's generation; abi_ok validation rejects.

## Session 2026-04-21 — adversarial audit of landed changes

Focused probe against the 5 surfaces introduced this session:
1. `LastRestartSlot` sysvar integration (cluster-restart stale gate)
2. `DEFAULT_PERMISSIONLESS_RESOLVE_STALE_SLOTS = 90_000` minimal-payload default
3. Funding ABI: e9 wire format, engine ceiling 10_000, dt ceiling 10_000_000
4. `MarketConfig.tvl_insurance_cap_mult` deposit cap (admin opt-in)
5. `Instruction::WithdrawInsuranceLimited` (tag 23) + `SlabHeader.insurance_operator` + `AUTHORITY_INSURANCE_OPERATOR = 4`

All candidates below **discarded** — either blocked by existing runtime check, out of stated trust model, or exploit test passed (i.e., attack did not work).

### D61. Operator bypasses bps/cooldown bounds via tag 20

**Hypothesis**: An operator holding only `insurance_operator` calls
`WithdrawInsurance` (tag 20) for an unbounded drain.

**Why discarded**:
- tag 20 handler at src/percolator.rs:7673 gates on
  `require_admin(header.insurance_authority, a_admin.key)` — a
  disjoint field from `header.insurance_operator`.
- Proof test: `test_withdraw_limited_operator_cannot_call_tag_20`
  resolves market, closes all accounts (both tag-20 gates now
  passable for `insurance_authority`), rotates `insurance_operator`
  to a fresh key, then attempts tag 20 → rejected. Positive
  control confirms `insurance_authority` still succeeds in the
  same state.

### D62. `max_bps = 10_000 + cooldown = 0` neutralizes bounded-drain limits

**Hypothesis**: Admin misconfigures the policy so operator can drain
100% per tx with no inter-call delay, rendering the "bounded" claim
cosmetic.

**Why discarded**:
- Init-time validation at src/percolator.rs:4348 rejects
  `max_bps > 10_000`.
- Init-time validation at src/percolator.rs:4353 rejects
  `max_bps > 0 && cooldown == 0`.
- Both blocks at `InitMarket`; the combination is unreachable in
  production markets.

### D63. Multi-ix tx cooldown bypass

**Hypothesis**: Operator packs N tag-23 instructions in a single tx.
`clock.slot` is constant within a tx, so all N calls see the same
slot and the cooldown check always returns 0 slot-gap.

**Why discarded**: First call in the tx updates `config.
last_insurance_withdraw_slot = clock.slot`. Call 2 sees
`last = clock.slot`, so `slot_gap = 0`. Since init enforces
`cooldown > 0`, the check `slot_gap < cooldown` (0 < N) trips and
call 2 is rejected. Only call 1 succeeds per tx.

### D64. `config.init_restart_slot` tampering after InitMarket

**Hypothesis**: A post-init mutation resets `init_restart_slot` to a
value ≥ current `LastRestartSlot`, defeating restart detection.

**Why discarded**: `grep` for writes to `init_restart_slot` shows
exactly one site — the `InitMarket` handler at src/percolator.rs:4752.
No `UpdateConfig`, `UpdateAuthority`, or other handler touches it.
The field is immutable post-init.

### D65. Cluster restart race during InitMarket

**Hypothesis**: `LastRestartSlot::get()` captures N. A restart bumps
it to N+1 mid-tx. Admin's init commits with stale `init_restart_slot = N`
but never sees the bump because it happened atomically.

**Why discarded**: Solana's execution model — a single transaction
does not span a restart event. Restarts halt all in-flight state;
the blockchain replays from the last confirmed slot with txs
re-applied or dropped. The syscall and the commit both happen
inside one atomic tx; there's no race window.

### D66. Deposit-cap bypass via insurance decrement within the same tx

**Hypothesis**: Some other instruction decrements insurance
mid-tx; the cap check in `DepositCollateral` uses a snapshot that
doesn't reflect the new value.

**Why discarded**: Handler loads `engine_ref(&data)?.insurance_fund.
balance.get()` immediately before the comparison. Single-threaded
per-tx semantics mean no concurrent mutation. If a prior
instruction in the same tx decremented insurance, the handler sees
the post-decrement value.

### D67. Tag 23 breaks conservation invariant `V ≥ C_tot + I`

**Hypothesis**: Tag 23 decrements insurance and vault by different
amounts, creating a `V < C_tot + I` state.

**Why discarded** (manual trace):
- Before: vault = V, insurance = I, c_tot = C. Conservation:
  `V ≥ C + I + net_pnl`.
- Commit: `engine.insurance_fund.balance = I - A`,
  `engine.vault = V.checked_sub(A)`. Both decremented by the
  same `A = amount_units`.
- After: `(V - A) ≥ C + (I - A) + net_pnl` ⟺ `V ≥ C + I + net_pnl`.
  Same invariant, preserved.
- SPL transfer moves `amount` base units (= `amount_units ×
  unit_scale` if scale > 0, else equal). Engine tracks units;
  SPL vault tracks base. Both sides of the equation stay
  consistent with `unit_scale` scaling.

### D68. Zeno-paradox lockout traps last residual

**Hypothesis**: Operator drains insurance until `insurance = 9`.
Cap formula: `cap = max(bps_cap, 10) = 10`. Clamp:
`cap = min(10, 9) = 9`. Operator requests 10 → rejected
(`10 > 9`). Request for 9 → ??

**Why discarded**: Handler logic
`if (amount_units as i128) > cap` uses strict greater-than. At
`cap = 9`, `amount_units = 9` passes (`9 > 9` is false). Operator
drains the exact remaining balance. Insurance reaches zero.

### D69. Tag 23 amount = 0 or dust-misaligned amount

**Why discarded**: Handler has
`if dust != 0 || amount_units == 0 { return InvalidArgument }`.
Both zero-unit withdrawals and unit-scale-misaligned amounts
are rejected before any state change.

### D70. Tag 23 spoofed accounts (vault, ATA, clock)

**Why discarded**:
- `verify_vault(a_vault, &auth, &mint, &Pubkey::new_from_array(
  config.vault_pubkey))` — cross-checks vault PDA, mint, and
  stored pubkey.
- `verify_token_account(a_operator_ata, a_operator.key, &mint)` —
  cross-checks ATA owner and mint.
- `accounts::expect_key(a_vault_pda, &auth)` — verifies the
  signing PDA account matches the derived authority.
- `Clock::from_account_info(a_clock)` — runtime verifies the
  sysvar key matches `sysvar::clock::ID`.

All four spoof vectors blocked.

### D71. Burned `insurance_authority` + bounded drain leaves residue that traps CloseSlab

**Hypothesis**: Operator drains via tag 23 but can't reach 0 (Zeno).
Residue > 0 means tag 20 is needed to zero insurance. But
`insurance_authority` is burned, so tag 20 is unreachable. Slab
rent is trapped forever.

**Why discarded**: D68 already shows tag 23's final-call clamp
lets the operator drain to exactly zero. No residue. CloseSlab
proceeds normally.

### D72. Stale `last_insurance_withdraw_slot` post-restart

**Hypothesis**: Pre-restart, operator's last call set
`last = 1000`. Post-restart, `clock.slot` resumes at 800. The
cooldown check does `800.saturating_sub(1000) = 0`, which is
`< cooldown`. The first post-restart tag-23 call would be
rejected — but if the operator passes `amount = 0` or exploits
some other path, maybe they bypass.

**Why discarded**: Tag 23 handler calls
`permissionless_stale_matured(&config, clock.slot)` before the
cooldown check. Post-restart, `LastRestartSlot::get() >
init_restart_slot`, so `permissionless_stale_matured` returns
true, and the handler returns `OracleStale` immediately. The
cooldown / stale-last-slot path is never reached post-restart —
no tag-23 call can succeed after a cluster restart. The market
is frozen; resolution goes through `ResolvePermissionless`.

### D73. Deposit-cap and SPL-transfer ordering race

**Hypothesis**: The cap check succeeds, but the SPL transfer
fails, and engine state is left inconsistent.

**Why discarded**: Handler ordering is
`cap check → collateral::deposit (SPL CPI) → engine.deposit_not_atomic`.
The cap check runs BEFORE any state mutation. If the SPL transfer
fails, the handler returns `Err`, Solana's runtime reverts the
entire tx atomically (including any vault balance change attempted
by the SPL program). Engine state is never mutated.

### D74. Operator drains below `insurance_floor`

**Hypothesis**: Admin sets `insurance_floor = 1_000` as a "minimum
insurance reserved against losses." Operator drains insurance to 0
via tag 23, undermining the floor contract.

**Why discarded** (with caveat):
- `insurance_floor` is a policy parameter used by
  `use_insurance_buffer(loss)` at percolator/src/percolator.rs:2318
  to compute `available = ins_bal.saturating_sub(floor)`. It
  controls loss-consumption, not an enforced minimum balance.
- The prior `WithdrawInsurance` (tag 20) also ignores
  `insurance_floor` — it zeros the balance entirely at teardown.
  Tag 23's behavior is consistent.
- If operators want a hard minimum balance, they must either
  (a) configure `max_bps` such that the steady-state drain rate
  stays above the floor, or (b) rely on the deposit-cap
  interaction (`tvl_insurance_cap_mult > 0`) to throttle TVL
  growth as insurance shrinks.
- **Caveat**: if `insurance_floor` is ever promoted to an
  invariant (spec change), tag 23 would need to grow a
  `cap = min(cap, ins - floor)` gate. For now the two paths are
  consistent in ignoring it.

### D75. CloseAccount bypass of deposit cap

**Hypothesis**: A closed account reduces `c_tot`. If cap was blocking
deposits, closing should unblock them. Attacker closes-and-reopens
repeatedly to churn capital past the cap.

**Why discarded**: CloseAccount correctly decrements `c_tot` via
`engine.close_account → set_capital(0)`. A closed account frees cap
room for new deposits. This is the **correct** behavior — closing
reduces TVL, shrinking `c_tot`; cap denominator (insurance) is
unchanged; new room appears. Churn is bounded by account-init
costs and the cap itself. Not an exploit.

### Summary — Session 2026-04-21

No ship-blocking findings. Authority split on
`insurance_operator` vs `insurance_authority` is structurally
enforced (confirmed by tightened bypass test). Cluster-restart
detection correctly gates all price-taking / state-mutating paths.
Deposit cap is fail-closed on enable-without-insurance (bootstrap
caveat documented; not a protocol hole). The tag-23 rate limits
are ultimately as strong as admin's `max_bps` + `cooldown`
configuration at `InitMarket`; init-time bounds prevent the
pathological combinations.

Tests: 674 pass across `default`, `small`, `medium` tiers.
Kani: 83/83 pass. Proof harnesses cover the pure restart-detected
comparison and all pre-existing authorization/matcher/oracle
surfaces.

## Session 2026-04-22 — oracle observation monotonicity

### Threat model

`clamp_external_price` previously had no ordering guarantee on Pyth /
Chainlink readings. Once the authority-fallback path was removed
(commit `86ea41f`), the wrapper's only price source for non-Hyperp
markets is the caller-supplied Pyth/Chainlink account. Pyth Pull is
permissionless: anyone can post a fresher `PriceUpdateV2` for any
feed at any time. That created a per-call cherry-pick:

1. State: `last_effective_price_e6 = 100`, latest on-chain Pyth
   shows `price = 102` clamped to `101` (cap = 1%/slot).
2. A second, valid-but-older Pyth account exists on-chain showing
   `price = 99`. Both readings are within `max_staleness_secs` of
   the current clock.
3. A caller chooses to submit the older account. `clamp_external_
   _price` clamps `99` against baseline `101` → returns `100`,
   advances baseline to `100`.
4. Subsequent ops now price against `100` instead of `101`. The
   caller has effectively pulled the baseline backward by a full
   cap-step.

Repeated systematically, this is a bounded but real price-direction
attack — the caller can keep the baseline pinned to whichever older
observation they prefer, within `oracle_price_cap_e2bps` per step.

### Fix

`MarketConfig.last_oracle_publish_time: i64` is added (stored in the
8-byte slot formerly reserved for `authority_timestamp`, no layout
change). On every accepted external observation, the wrapper writes
`config.last_oracle_publish_time = publish_time`.

`clamp_external_price` now applies a one-way clock to the source-feed
timestamp:

```text
publish_time >= last_oracle_publish_time
    → clamp the submitted observation against the baseline,
      advance baseline + timestamp.

publish_time <  last_oracle_publish_time
    → return last_effective_price_e6 unchanged.
      Do NOT advance baseline or timestamp.
      Do NOT error — the caller's tx still succeeds.
```

Pyth's `publish_time` and Chainlink's `timestamp` are signed by the
respective off-chain networks and cannot be forged client-side, so
they're a sound ordering signal.

### Why graceful (return stored), not strict (return error)

The strict variant — reject any older observation outright — was
considered and rejected. It deadlocks legitimate callers whose
signing path is asynchronous from the Solana tip:

- Hardware wallets that take seconds to confirm.
- Multi-sig flows that batch signatures across minutes.
- Offline signers that ship pre-signed txs.
- Any tx that lands a few seconds after a competing keeper
  submitted a fresher Pyth update.

These callers' txs would need an embedded oracle-account-version
parameter to retry safely against tip movement. Forcing them to
retry with a fresh Pyth account each round is a permanent loop
under any contention.

The graceful variant gives the caller's tx the freshest known price
the wrapper has on file. It cannot move state backward (the
older-observation branch is purely read-only on baseline). The cap-
step cherry-pick is closed because the caller can no longer pick
"older observation processed against current baseline" — they only
get "current baseline as-is."

### What's preserved vs. surrendered

Preserved:
- `last_effective_price_e6` is monotonic with respect to the
  one-way clock: it only moves on observations newer than the
  last accepted one.
- Caller cannot rewind baseline by replaying an old observation.
- Circuit-breaker clamp still applies to all forward observations.
- All pre-existing terminal-stale guarantees
  (`permissionless_stale_matured`) hold unchanged.

Surrendered:
- Observation freshness is not enforced at the per-tx level. A
  caller submitting an older Pyth account is priced against the
  stored baseline, which may differ from the most recent on-chain
  Pyth reading by up to one cap-step. This is the same surface
  area as the wrapper had before the monotonicity field existed,
  with the explicit constraint that the baseline cannot rewind.

### InitMarket bootstrap

InitMarket now seeds `last_oracle_publish_time` from the genesis
Pyth read (non-Hyperp markets only; Hyperp leaves it at 0). This
prevents an immediate post-init replay of an even-older observation
from poisoning the baseline before any normal-path crank has run.

### ResolveMarket

The non-Hyperp admin `ResolveMarket` path also performs a direct
external read (it bypasses `clamp_external_price` because §9.8
deviation band wants the raw, un-clamped oracle). The same graceful
fallback applies there: an older observation substitutes the stored
`last_effective_price_e6` as `live_oracle_price`, mirroring the
live policy.

### Tests

- `test_oracle_older_observation_uses_stored_price_and_does_not_rewind`:
  asserts the graceful behavior — older observation succeeds, but
  baseline + timestamp don't move, even when the submitted price is
  wildly different.
- `test_oracle_publish_time_equal_observation_succeeds`: regression
  guard that equal-timestamp re-reads (e.g., two txs in the same
  slot reading the same on-chain Pyth account) keep working.

## Session 2026-04-26 — A1 unlock-vector sweep on v12.19.13

### Threat model

The 5_000_000_000-unit insurance seed in
`tests/test_a1_siphon_regression.rs` is the only pool an attacker can
extract without owning a matching deposit (every other vault balance
belongs to a specific user/LP whose owner-binding signer is required
to release it). The whole v12.19.x rework on this branch hardens the
three layers that defend that seed:

1. `max_price_move_bps_per_slot` — per-slot oracle-move cap
   (immutable RiskParam).
2. §1.4 solvency envelope —
   `max_price_move·max_accrual_dt + funding + liq_fee ≤ maint_margin`.
3. §12.21 admission-threshold gate —
   `admit_h_max_consumption_threshold_bps`.

This session re-probes the four highest-leverage angles where a
regression in those layers could land an unlock. All discarded.

### D76. c447686 same-slot catchup leaves a stale-engine read window

**Hypothesis**: The new `flat_same_slot_price_update` flag in
`ensure_market_accrued_to_now` (src/percolator.rs:3735–3744) covers
the flat-market case (oi=0) but not `gap == 0 ∧ non-flat OI ∧
fresh_price ≠ P_last`. If an attacker can land a fresh observation in
the same slot a Trade* lands in, the engine's `last_oracle_price`
stays stale until the next slot — a same-tx follow-up op then prices
against the stale value and extracts the discrepancy.

**Why discarded**:
- Within a single tx the oracle account's `publish_time` is constant,
  so a follow-up op reads the same `fresh_price` the Trade already
  installed; the discrepancy never arises.
- Cross-tx: the next slot's accrue runs `catchup_accrue` (chunked
  per-slot-cap) which respects the §1.4 cap. The flat-only fix is a
  bookkeeping correction (engine `last_oracle_price` ← config
  `last_effective_price_e6`), not a value-extraction surface — the
  fresh price applies via the next op's mandatory accrue regardless.
- Same-slot non-flat ⇒ Trade* itself called `accrue_market_to`
  (src/percolator.rs:6516, 6523, 5905, 5912 etc.), so the engine sees
  the price.

### D77. UpdateConfig fast-forward bypasses §1.4 envelope

**Hypothesis**: UpdateConfig (Tag 16, src/percolator.rs:7222–7405)
mutates funding params; an admin attacker pairs it with a stale
oracle / omitted oracle / cap-evading argument shape to advance the
clock past the envelope without chunking, then opens a position
priced against the now-stale `last_oracle_price`.

**Why discarded** — the handler is fortified on every angle I tried:
- `accounts::expect_len(accounts, 4)` (line 7240) makes the oracle
  account mandatory; admin cannot select Degenerate by omission.
- `permissionless_stale_matured` gate (line 7293–7295): UpdateConfig
  on a terminally-stale market is rejected with `OracleStale`.
- f11dca2: `read_price_and_stamp` errors propagate (line 7363); a
  stale oracle no longer falls through to a rate=0 degenerate arm.
- Anti-retroactivity: `funding_rate_e9` captured BEFORE any config
  mutation (line 7286) and used in the boundary accrue (line 7382).
- Funding cap gated against `engine.params.max_abs_funding_e9_per_slot`
  (line 7273–7275), with explicit i128-space comparison to defeat
  `as u64` wrap.
- `catchup_accrue` (line 7380) chunks the gap before the boundary
  accrue, so even a wide jump respects the per-slot cap.
- `reject_any_target_lag` (line 7392) blocks any post-mutation state
  whose target lag exceeds the safety budget.
- The §1.4 terms `max_price_move_bps_per_slot` and
  `maintenance_margin_bps` are init-immutable RiskParams; no
  UpdateConfig field shifts the envelope.

### D78. Sibling no-oracle paths missed by 7e82eb0's §9.2 gate

**Hypothesis**: 7e82eb0 added §9.2 stale-gap gates to TopUpInsurance,
ReclaimEmptyAccount, and DepositFeeCredits. Sibling no-oracle paths
that mutate engine state (InitUser fee→insurance line 4935, InitLP
fee→insurance line 5060, DepositCollateral line 5182,
ReclaimEmptyAccount post-5e0b55c, DepositFeeCredits post-5e0b55c) may
have been missed; an attacker advances `current_slot` past the
envelope on a flat market, then opens a position to extract the
discrepancy.

**Why discarded**:
- DepositCollateral / InitUser-deposit / InitLP-deposit pass
  `clock.slot` directly to `engine.deposit_not_atomic`; the engine's
  internal `check_live_accrual_envelope` enforces
  `gap ≤ max_accrual_dt_slots` (per the comment at
  src/percolator.rs:5170–5173). If the gap exceeds the envelope,
  `deposit_not_atomic` rejects, so the inline `top_up_insurance_fund`
  call afterward (lines 4935 / 5060) is unreachable on a stale gap.
- TopUpInsurance (line 7061), ReclaimEmptyAccount (line 8194), and
  DepositFeeCredits (line 8352) all call `check_no_oracle_live_envelope`
  — the OI-qualified §9.2 gate at src/percolator.rs:3415–3427.
- 5e0b55c's relaxation from a strict gap-only gate (per 7e82eb0) to
  the OI-qualified `check_no_oracle_live_envelope` is intentional and
  safe: when `oi_any == false`, neither funding nor price-move accrual
  is active (catchup_accrue itself early-returns at
  src/percolator.rs:3654 in that state), so advancing `current_slot`
  past `last_market_slot + max_dt` on a flat market loses no
  funding/mark window. The next oracle-backed op chunks the gap via
  `catchup_accrue` regardless, respecting the per-slot cap.
- Cross-tx attacker who flips flat → non-flat: the position-opening
  Trade goes through `ensure_market_accrued_to_now_with_policy`
  (e.g. line 5885) which calls `catchup_accrue` (chunked) before
  admitting the trade — the per-slot cap still binds.

### D79. ResolveMarket Degenerate-arm forced on healthy market

**Hypothesis**: a7186d5 made `ResolveMarket` take an explicit `mode`
per §9.8. ed04539 cleaned up dead Ordinary-arm logic. If admin can
select `mode = 1` (Degenerate, settles at rate=0) on a healthy market
with non-flat OI, the §1.4 envelope is short-circuited at settlement —
positions are paid out at `engine.last_oracle_price` regardless of
the live mark.

**Why discarded** — the Degenerate gate (src/percolator.rs:7586–7622)
requires the oracle to be *genuinely dead*, not admin-asserted-dead:
- `permissionless_stale_matured(&config, clock_gate.slot)` true
  (hard timeout reached), OR
- Hyperp: `clock.slot - last_update > 3 × max_staleness_secs ∧
  oracle_initialized`, OR
- Non-Hyperp: a live `oracle::read_engine_price_e6` returns
  `OracleStale` or `OracleConfTooWide`.

If none hold, the handler returns `OracleInvalid`. A live oracle on
the same slot defeats the Degenerate arm entirely. Mode values
outside {0, 1} fall through to the Ordinary arm, which requires a
live oracle and rejects on `permissionless_stale_matured`. Admin
cannot pick a settlement mode that bypasses the envelope.

### Conclusion

Four probes, four discards. The three v12.19 defense layers
(per-slot cap, §1.4 envelope, admission threshold) are intact across
every wrapper-side mutation path I walked. The 5_000_000_000-unit
insurance seed is not extractable through:
- same-slot catchup interleaving (D76),
- UpdateConfig fast-forward (D77),
- no-oracle path stale-gap bypass (D78), or
- ResolveMarket mode confusion (D79).

Residual surface (not probed this session) — same as the prior
session's "next sweep targets": funding rate at envelope boundary
with bilateral OI at MAX_VAULT_TVL, multi-block keeper-timing
collusion, and any future cross-market/multi-slab deployment.
